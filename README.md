## Compiler in Rust
This is a really in deep development compiler where I'm just learning what I can with compiler books 
and applying that knowledge here! It's still not very efficient, (e.g I still need to add string interning)
but I wanna get things going and keep performance thinking out of the way when applying implementations
that I've never done before. At the moment I'm doing changes still to the AST parser, Lexer, and semantic analysis.
I've yet to start code gen and things like that.
